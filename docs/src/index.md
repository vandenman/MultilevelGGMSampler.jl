# MultilevelGGMSampler

MultilevelGGMSampler is a julia package to sample from multilevel Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs).
It is sensible to use this package if your data consist of a two levels. For example, in fMRI, the time-points of a scan are nested within individual participants, the individual-level, and the participants form a population, which we call the group-level.
